Supply-chain security for Rust

When run without a subcommand, `cargo vet` will invoke the `check` subcommand. See `cargo vet help check` for more details.

Usage: cargo vet [OPTIONS]
       cargo vet <COMMAND>

Commands:
  check             \[default\] Check that the current project has been vetted
  suggest           Suggest some low-hanging fruit to review
  init              Initialize cargo-vet for your project
  inspect           Fetch the source of a package
  diff              Yield a diff against the last reviewed version
  certify           Mark a package as audited
  import            Import a new peer's imports
  trust             Trust a given crate and publisher
  regenerate        Explicitly regenerate various pieces of information
  add-exemption     Mark a package as exempted from review
  record-violation  Declare that some versions of a package violate certain audit criteria
  fmt               Reformat all of vet's files (in case you hand-edited them)
  prune             Prune unnecessary imports and exemptions
  aggregate         Fetch and merge audits from multiple sources into a single `audits.toml` file
  explain-audit     Print the computed audit path used by cargo-vet to certify a package for a given critera
  dump-graph        Print the cargo build graph as understood by `cargo vet`
  gc                Clean up old packages from the vet cache
  renew             Renew wildcard audit expirations
  help              Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version

Global Options:
      --manifest-path <PATH>
          Path to Cargo.toml

      --store-path <STORE_PATH>
          Path to the supply-chain directory

      --no-all-features
          Don't use --all-features
          
          We default to passing --all-features to `cargo metadata` because we want to analyze your full dependency tree

      --no-default-features
          Do not activate the `default` feature

      --features <FEATURES>
          Space-separated list of features to activate

      --locked
          Do not fetch new imported audits

      --frozen
          Avoid the network entirely, requiring either that the cargo cache is populated or the dependencies are vendored. Requires --locked

      --no-minimize-exemptions
          Prevent commands such as `check` and `certify` from automatically cleaning up unused exemptions

      --no-registry-suggestions
          Prevent commands such as `check` and `suggest` from suggesting registry imports

      --verbose <VERBOSE>
          How verbose logging should be (log level)
          
          [default: warn]
          [possible values: off, error, warn, info, debug, trace]

      --output-file <OUTPUT_FILE>
          Instead of stdout, write output to this file

      --log-file <LOG_FILE>
          Instead of stderr, write logs to this file (only used after successful CLI parsing)

      --output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
          The format of the output
          
          [default: human]

          Possible values:
          - human: Print output in a human-readable form
          - json:  Print output in a machine-readable form with minimal extra context

      --cache-dir <CACHE_DIR>
          Use the following path instead of the global cache directory
          
          The cache stores information such as the summary results used by vet's suggestion machinery, cached results from crates.io APIs, and checkouts of crates from crates.io in some cases. This is generally automatically managed in the system cache directory.
          
          This mostly exists for testing vet itself.

      --filter-graph <FILTER_GRAPH>
          Filter out different parts of the build graph and pretend that's the true graph
          
          Example: `--filter-graph="exclude(any(eq(is_dev_only(true)),eq(name(serde_derive))))"`
          
          This mostly exists to debug or reduce projects that cargo-vet is mishandling.
          Combining this with `cargo vet --output-format=json dump-graph` can produce an
          input that can be added to vet's test suite.
          
          
          The resulting graph is computed as follows:
          
          1. First compute the original graph
          2. Then apply the filters to find the new set of nodes
          3. Create a new empty graph
          4. For each workspace member that still exists, recursively add it and its dependencies
          
          This means that any non-workspace package that becomes "orphaned" by the filters will
          be implicitly discarded even if it passes the filters.
          
          Possible filters:
          
          * `include($query)`: only include packages that match this filter
          * `exclude($query)`: exclude packages that match this filter
          
          
          Possible queries:
          
          * `any($query1, $query2, ...)`: true if any of the listed queries are true
          * `all($query1, $query2, ...)`: true if all of the listed queries are true
          * `not($query)`: true if the query is false
          * `$property`: true if the package has this property
          
          
          Possible properties:
          
          * `name($string)`: the package's name (i.e. `serde`)
          * `version($version)`: the package's version (i.e. `1.2.0`)
          * `is_root($bool)`: whether it's a root in the original graph (ignoring dev-deps)
          * `is_workspace_member($bool)`: whether the package is a workspace-member (can be tested)
          * `is_third_party($bool)`: whether the package is considered third-party by vet
          * `is_dev_only($bool)`: whether it's only used by dev (test) builds in the original graph

      --cargo-arg <CARGO_ARG>
          Arguments to pass through to cargo. It can be specified multiple times for multiple arguments.
          
          Example: `--cargo-arg=-Zbindeps`
          
          This allows using unstable options in Cargo if a project's Cargo.toml requires them.
