`quote` is a utility crate used by proc-macros to generate TokenStreams
conveniently from source code. The bulk of the logic is some complex
interlocking `macro_rules!` macros which are used to parse and build the
`TokenStream` within the proc-macro.

This crate contains no unsafe code, and the internal logic, while difficult to
read, is generally straightforward. I have audited the the quote macros, ident
formatter, and runtime logic.
