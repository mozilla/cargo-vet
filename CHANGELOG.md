# Unreleased

* `cargo vet check --frozen` (a disabled network) will infer the existence of crates using versions
  in audits when checking audit-as-crates-io policies (#661)

# Version 0.10.1 (2025-02-10)

* `cargo vet` will no longer prompt to renew expiring wildcard audits for inactive crates (#648)
* `cargo vet renew --expiring` will no longer renew expiring wildcard audits for inactive crates (#649)

# Version 0.10.0 (2024-10-03)

* Various improvements to the diff and inspect subcommands:
  * Added support for using [diff.rs](https://diff.rs) with the diff and inspect subcommands (#625, #633, #635)
  * The diff and inspect subcommands will remember the most recently used mode, and automatically use it next time (#633)
  * The default mode for diff and inspect was changed to diff.rs (#611, #633)

* Crates.io metadata caching was changed to avoid issues where incorrect crates.io state was being cached locally, leading to confusing results (#631)

* Unnecessary imports and publisher entries will be removed when adding importing another audit or publisher entry for the same crate (#621)
  * This is intended to reduce churn and unnecessary entries in `imports.lock` without running prune explicitly

* Network requests made by cargo vet will now respect the cargo `http.cainfo` config option (#615)

* Suggest output will now also mention criteria which implies the minimum required criteria (#614)

* Audit files being aggregated with the aggregate subcommand will now be validated before being aggregated, to avoid generating invalid aggregate audits files (#586)

* Local wildcard audits are now preferred over imported wildcard audits when determining audit paths (#588)

* Binary releases are now built in CI and [published to github](https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/releases) using [`cargo dist`](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist) (#600)
